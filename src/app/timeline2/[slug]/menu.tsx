        'How were the Israelites guided out of Egypt?The Lord was going before them in a pillar of cloud by day to lead them on the way, and in a pillar of fire by night to give them light. The one pillar changed from smoke during the day to fire during the night. Not only did it lead Israel on its journey, it enabled them to travel by day and by night. It also might have been large enough to provide shade in the daytime and light when it was dark. It was also a constant presence, because He did not take away the pillar of cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire by night, from before the people. This became a symbol of the LORDâ€™s abiding presence with His people. They could rely on His leadership, and it was in their best interest to obey and follow Him. The pillar was a visible confirmation of the constant presence of the LORD. The presence of the LORD meant that the Israelites were always led in the right direction and unceasingly protected as they travelled.',
